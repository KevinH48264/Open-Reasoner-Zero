Let\\'s denote \\\\(n + 1 = k\\\\). Then \\\\(n = k - 1\\\\). Substituting \\\\(n = k - 1\\\\) into the expression \\\\(n^2 + 1\\\\), we get \\\\((k-1)^2 + 1\\\\).\\n\\n\\\\[\\n(k-1)^2 + 1 = k^2 - 2k + 1 + 1 = k^2 - 2k + 2\\n\\\\]\\n\\nWe need \\\\(k^2 - 2k + 2\\\\) to be divisible by \\\\(k\\\\). Let\\'s denote \\\\(k = n + 1\\\\). Then we need \\\\(n^2 + 1\\\\) to be divisible by \\\\(n + 1\\\\). Let\\'s perform polynomial long division of \\\\(n^2 + 1\\\\) by \\\\(n + 1\\\\):\\n\\n1. **Polynomial Long Division:**\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\x0crac{n^2 + 1}{n + 1}\\n   \\\\]\\n   - Divide the leading term of the numerator \\\\(n^2\\\\) by the leading term of the denominator \\\\(n\\\\), which gives \\\\(n\\\\).\\n   - Multiply \\\\(n\\\\) by \\\\(n + 1\\\\): \\\\(n \\\\cdot (n + 1) = n^2 + n\\\\).\\n   - Subtract this from the original polynomial:\\n     \\\\[\\n     (n^2 + 1) - (n^2 + n) = 1 - n\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Now, divide the leading term of the new polynomial \\\\(-n\\\\) by \\\\(n\\\\), which gives \\\\(-1\\\\).\\n   - Multiply \\\\(-1\\\\) by \\\\(n + 1\\\\): \\\\(-1 \\\\cdot (n + 1) = -n - 1\\\\).\\n   - Subtract this from \\\\(-n\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     -n - ( -n - 1) = -n + n + 1 = 1\\n     \\\\]\\n\\nSo, the division \\\\(\\x0crac{n^2 + 1}{n + 1}\\\\) gives a quotient of \\\\(n - 1\\\\) and a remainder of \\\\(1\\\\).

    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n",
    "   - We need to find the area under the curve \\( y = \\sin(x) \\) from \\( x = 0 \\) to \\( x = \\pi\\).\n",
    "   - This translates to evaluating the definite integral \\(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin(x) \\, dx\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up the Integral:**\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(x) \\, dx\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate the Integral:**\n",
    "   - The antiderivative of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(-\\cos(x)\\).\n",
    "   - Therefore, we need to evaluate \\(\\left[-\\cos(x)\\right]_0^\\pi\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply the Limits:**\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   \\left[-\\cos(x)\\right]_0^\\pi = -\\cos(\\pi) - (-\\cos(0))\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "   - At \\(x = \\pi\\):\n",

    "     \\[\n",
    "     -\\cos(0) = -1\n",

      "Evaluator Supervisor Response: <think>\\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The task is to verify if the primary reasoning behind the Proposed Evaluation's verdict matches the Ground Truth Assessment's primary reasoning. Specifically, we're focusing on whether the main reasons for the verdict align, not whether the verdicts themselves are correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll examine the Ground Truth Assessment's reasoning. It outlines a series of steps where they substitute specific values into the functional equation to deduce properties of the function \\( f \\). They start by setting \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\), which leads them to conclude \\( f(0) = 0 \\). Then, by setting \\( x = y \\), they derive another equation. Substituting \\( y = -1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\) helps them find relationships between \\( f(-1) \\) and \\( f(1) \\). They assume a linear form \\( f(x) = cx \\) and find \\( c = 1 \\), leading to \\( f(x) = x \\). Finally, they verify this by substituting \\( x = -1 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, looking at the Proposed Evaluation's reasoning, it seems to follow the same logical steps. They correctly substitute values, deduce necessary conditions, and arrive at the conclusion \\( f(x) = x \\). The primary reasoning here is methodical substitution and deduction, which is exactly what the Ground Truth Assessment used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the primary reasons for both assessments match because they both rely on substituting specific values into the functional equation to systematically determine the form of \\( f \\). The methods are consistent, even if the phrasing or structure differs slightly.\n",

The diameter (d) of the circle is twice the radius (r), and the area (A) of a circle can be calculated using the formula A = πr^2. We can rewrite this formula using the diameter as A = (π/4)d^2.\n",
